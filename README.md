Introduction:
===========
    Just follow through the gowiki example to get familiar with golang. Maybe I 
    can upgrade this to a simple blog site, and a few basic things should be done next:

    - make a content list.
    - reorganize the code to make it more customizable by reading a config file.
    - remove the edit function. It's better to do the editing locally on vim, then
    push the content to github, then use something like github hook to push it automatically to my vps.
    - A little decoration of the UI, use something like Bootstrap.
