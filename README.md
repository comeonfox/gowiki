Introduction:
===========
    Just follow through the gowiki example to get familiar with golang. Maybe I can upgrade this to a simple blog site, and a few basic things should be done next:

    - make a content list.
    - reconstruture the code to make it more customizable by reading a config file.
    - remove the edict function. It's better do the editing locally on vim, the push the content to github, then use something like github hook to push it automatically to my vps.
    - A little demonstration of the UI, use something like Bootstrap.
